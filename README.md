# Quick Jot 📝

A minimalist sticky note app built with C++ and Qt 6. I built this for my girlfriend after she mentioned that her current notes app didn’t meet her needs. Quick Jot is designed to be lightweight, elegant, and always-on-top when you need it most.

> Notes are automatically saved to your **Documents** folder in a subfolder called `QuickJot`, so your thoughts are always safe and easy to find.

## ✨ Features

- **Always on Top** option so your note never gets buried
- Loads your previous note on startup
- Automatically saves your notes on close
- Fast, minimal, and privacy-friendly
